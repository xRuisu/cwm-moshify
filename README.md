<h1 >Course Study From Instructor Mosh Hamadani</h1>
<p>Completed website building, learning many new things for website development. Things such as proper convention, css and html markup, typography, building for production and deployment and so much more.
I do not claim any of this code or website as my own. This was simply a study for me to learn HTML5 & CSS for more front-end familiarity. That way I can begin working on more studys to combine the knowledge I have gained being back-end & front-end.</p>
